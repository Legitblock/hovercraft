This is a demo for LegitBlock! You can view it as a finished presentation
at http://legitblock.com/hovercraft

You can render this presentation to HTML with the command::

    make ci

And then view the build/index.html file to see how it turned out.

If you are seeing this text, and not reading this as source code, you are
doing it wrong! It's going to be confusing and not very useful.

Use The Source, Luke! But first you probably want to read through the
official documentation at https://hovercraft.readthedocs.io/

The problem:
============

Voting needs to be verifiable and immutable
-------------------------------------------

.. note::

    1. Blockchain provides verification and immutability

----

Voting is important to modern life
==================================

* It is the primary decision mechanism of our government

* It is also the primary decision mechanism of corporations

* Co-ops, non-profit organizations, PTA, etc

.. note::

    2400 years ago Plato writes The Republic


----

Git as document history
=======================

* Git is used to track changes in a set of documents

* Many tools available: github, Pull Requests

* Convenient (and powerful!)

.. note::

   Git is a very powerful tool

----

But then there was Blockchain
=============================

* brings an immmutable history

* brings a way for the organization to raise funds with an ICO


.. note::

   ICO ICO

...git...
=========

.. note::

    If you have more notes than fit in the console, you can scroll down, but
    more handily, you can scroll the text up by pressing space bar.

----

:data-rotate: 90

...blockchain...
================

.. note::

   If there isn't more text to scroll up, space bar will go to the next
   slide. Therefore you, as a presenter, just press space every time you run
   out of things to say!

:data-scale: 0.1

...and zoom!
============

.. note::

    Zooming is cool. But one day it will grow old as well. What will we do
    then to make presentations interesting?

Start an Organization
=====================

So we are back to square one.

Let's start an organization


.. note::

    It's probably back to making bad jokes again.

----

Gather those involved
=====================

Write your bylaws.

Import them into a repo!

Sign with gpg keys!

----

:id: ThreeD
:data-y: r1200
:data-rotate-x: 180

Sign with GPG keys?!?
=====================

*But.what.are.those?..*

.. note::

    Wow! 3D! You didn't see that one coming, did you?

----


GPG creates cryptography keys
=============================

* Encryption
* Signing
* Authorization

.. note::

    GPG keys are used for encryption, signing and authorization.

----

:data-x: r800

...and by combining GPG + Git + blockchain
==========================================

* bulletproof

* verifiable

* immutable



.. note::

    The endless repositioning of slides is what prompted me to write
    Hovercraft! in the first place.

----

:id: thequestion
:data-x: r0
:data-y: r-1200

*Is there no solution?*
=======================

Of course there is!

.. note::

    What would be the point of this slide show if I didn't have a solution?
    Duh!
